            <p class="preface">Welcome to Release Notes: where I talk about the decision making behind articles, videos, and other creations.</p>

            <p>Your newsletter might by someone's first impression of you.

            <p>In September and October, the majority of my audience were my friends, around > 60% were from TKS. (TKS is a program that encourages every student to publish a newsletter.) The majority of my subscribers were probably subscribed to 10 of their friends' newsletters and would see dozens of more on TKS Life. (TKS Life is the "social media pIatform" that TKS built for students to share what they have worked on, including posting newsletters.) I wanted a way to differentiate myself, to make my newsletter stand out in the sea of 10s of newsletters. Since the majority of my subscriber list were teens, focused on making my newsletter funny, with comics and memes.</p>

            <p>In December, the percentage of my subscribers who are teens have dropped from 100% to about 80%. Although that is still a majority, I no longer want to cater my newsletters to a teen audience. I no longer want to cater them to an instant gratification audience who don't have the attention span to read through the whole thing without a comic, which is what I did in September and October. I want to provide value.</p>

            <p><strong>I focused more on making my newsletters engaging than making them valuable.</strong> I don't feel so good about that.</p>

            <p class="hidden">i dont feel so goo dmeme</p>

            <p>The Internet has enough funny, instant gratification content out there and frankly, we don't need any additional people actively creating more.</p>

            <p>As was I looking through old newsletters whos lists I impulsively subscribed to months ago wanting to see lives of kool smart people, I found Sigil's newsletter talking about how he's practicing authenticity to bring value to his newsletter subscribers. That gave me a realization—that wasn't what I was doing. Sure, my stuff can be funny, but people reading my newsletters won't get any value from it.</p>

            <p>So that's what I want to do. I want to make my newsletters valuable. I started trying that out for my Oct newsletter when Idropped some productivity tools, a podcast rec, + how I'm working on discipline. This month also tried to do that by plugging wisdom from twitter and some discipline tips.</p>

            <p>Also, now that I got some newsletter subscribers that aren't my friends. They're people who I don't know. This newsletter might be someone's first impression of me, do I want that impression to be someone who makes memes n draws comics or someone who is working on self improvement and trying to provide value?</p>

            <hr class="section-break">

            <h3>Do my comics add value?</h3>

            <p>In last month's release notes, I said they did.</p>

            <p>I'm sure they make me stand out. A recent person I met told me that she was looking forward to meeting me because she saw my comics. That legitimately made my week.</p>

            <p>But the thing is, I started making the comics in the first place to capture the attention of people who don't have the attention span to read the text of the newsletter. My intention with the comics in the first place was for the sole purpose of engagement.</p>

            <p>That means I didn't intend to create them to add value.</p>

            <p>Do I sound mean saying "people who don't have the attention span"? Lol maybe, but I'm writing that based on my personal experience — I am someone who doesn't have the attention span to read through most people's newsletters' full text. I catered my comics to people with attention spans similar to me.</p>

            <p>As I was looking to create my blog, I was reading some other people's blog posts and stumbled across this. REalizations - felt that my content was chocolate covered broccoli.</p>

            <p>CCB are basically engagement thigns that don't add value.</p>

            <p>Good example of chocolate covered broccoli:</p>

            <p>Felt that my comics were like that too- content created for the sole purpose of engagement, without adding any value. engaging, yes. valuable, no.</p>
