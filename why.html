            <p>From a materialistic standpoint, publishing blog posts on your personal website doesn't make sense. If you want to grow an audience [1], Medium is a much better bet: your content gets distributed across the platform with the possiblility that thousands of readers will pick it up, there's a follow button where you can collect followers, your posts can get liked (or <em>clapped</em>), and a comment section at the end of each article. Compare that to a personal blogging site: there's no way for eaders to follow, like, or comment. There's no way for this content to get stumbled upon, unless people are looking at my <a href="https://tks.life/profile/laura.gao">portfolio</a>.</p>

            <p>I get maybe 400 views per Medium article, 200 views on youtube, and probably 5 views per blog post.</p>

            <p>But it is in this lack of discovery that gives me the most freedom. Here, I can write however I want, use as little engagement tactics as I please, and no harm will be caused to me. It may make more sense to publish on Medium because I get more views there, but Medium confines me to high quality standards and I fear publishing something subpar will lower my average views</p>

            <p>As wise woman <a href="https://preview.mailerlite.com/m7x9u7">Emaan</a> said,</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>I came to the realization that there are two types of artists:</p>
                <p>1. Use their emotion to drive their creativity - their art has no bounds aka technicality is out the window (literally me LOL)</p>
                <p>2. Use technique and are articulate to evoke a specific emotion from the viewer (what I thought I should be)</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>Similarly, there are 2 buckets of writing:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Writing as an outlet for your thoughts</li>
                <li>Writing using techniques thinking about intended reader experience, trying to convince others that your thoughts are credible</li>
            </ol>

            <p>My Medium is for type 2. This blog is for type 1.</p>

                <p>[1] Which you probably do - after all, the whole purpose of making content is to put it on the stage of the Internet, to get people to see it, right? <em>Right?</em></p>
