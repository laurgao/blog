            <p>Dear Topsie,</p>

            <p>We can take this opportunity to create something positive.</p>

            <p>Yes, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/fsociety_toronto/">@fsociety_toronto</a> should take this opportunity to create something positive. But so could we. We are half of the equation; our response definitely has influence on whether something positive comes out or not.</p>

            <p>Whether the exposed emails are fake or not, for example, is irrelevant -- by only talking about that, we're not addressing the issue head on. By issue, I am referring to the inequality between TOPS and non-TOPS students, or the fact that many students believe that there is inequality. <a href="#footnote1">[1]</a></p>

            <p>If you disagree with how a dictator is running your country and you want to enact change, you have no choice but to stage a violent rebellion. <a href="#footnote2">[2]</a> I'm not saying TOPS is a dictatorship, but my hypothesis is that the owner of @fsociety_toronto felt like they had to hack the VP in order to get their voice heard. They probably tried to speak out previously and was unsuccessful.</p>

            <p>(If we report and take down the account, we are further shushing them out even more.)</p>

            <p>Think about it. Last year, if a non-TOPS student told you they thought TOPS was unfair, would you have listened?</p>

            <p>We can either choose to suppress the person, or to take the chance to make meaningful change. Clearly, someone is passionate and we can leverage that.</p>

            <p>If we let this go by, sure maybe we've dealt with one person, but we did not deal with the problem. The problem will resurface later -- if you cut off the leaves, the plant will grow back as long as the roots are in place. Deal with the root cause, not the symptoms.</p>

            <p>Cheers,</p>

            <p>Laura</p>


            <hr class="section-break">
            <p>P.S.</p>

            <p>I don't agree with how @fsociety_toronto handled the situation so far -- with the doxing and exposing. I agree with Sigil that writing a proposal about inequality would be helpful.</p>

            <p><blockquote>"They handled the situation poorly, so why shall we work with them? I'll wait for if they write the proposal."</blockquote></p>

            <p>If you truly want to see this issue resolved, you wouldn't wait for someone else to do the work before you act.</p>

            <p>You can act now! It's definitely possible: DM @fsociety_toronto, help them with writing the proposal. Hear em out & consider the change they want to enact -- changing TOPS to start at Grade 11 (and more?). Maybe it's a good idea, maybe it's a horrible idea, but you cannot decide without concrete reasons.</p>

                    <li id="footnote2">By the way, this is what makes democracy a better system: political opponents do not have to engage in violence order to enact change. They simply have to run for opposition. This is also what makes democracies more stable: the fact that political opponents do not have to take down the previous government in order to enact change. - Emmeat Shear, CEO of Twitch (on The Quest podcast)</li>
